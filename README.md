- MongoDB: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.
- NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
- ExpressJS: A server side framework for NodeJS. A framework on the other side is a compilation of code libraries that a developer can use to speed up development work. Rather than writing code completely from scratch.
- ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on javascript, used to build UI components.
